The `measurementfree` package allows you to calculate several estimations of the quality of your survey questions and also adjust your estimations for measurement error.

Assuming you have a data frame with the `reliability`, `validity` and `quality` of your question, you can correct for the quality and common method variance easily.

Load the package as:

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("sociometricresearch/measurementfree")
library(measurementfree)
```

## A simple example

`measurementfree` introduces the concept of a measurement error design, such as the `survey` package has a survey design object. You can define this measurement error design with three objects: your model design, your measurement error data and the data of the analysis. For a simple case, let's assume that the columns `mpg`, `cyl` and `disp` for `mtcars` were measured with the same method (e.g. likert scale), then we could define the measurement error design object as this:

```{r }
# This is the model definition
model_definition <- "~ mpg + cyl + disp"

# The measurement error data
me_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                        question = c("mpg", "cyl", "disp"),
                        reliability = c(0.729, 0.815, 0.68),
                        validity = c(0.951, 0.944, 0.79),
                        quality = c(0.693, 0.77, 0.89)
                      )

# Define your measurement error design
me_obj <- medesign(model_definition, mtcars, me_data)
me_obj
```

Once you have that object, we simply pass it to `me_cmv_cor` to adjust the correlation of `mpg`, `cyl`, and `cyl` for common method variance as well as their quality:

```{r }
me_cmv_cor(me_obj)
```

## Another simple example

For this example let's assume that `mpg` and `cyl` were measured with the same method and `disp` and `drat` were measured with another method, then we can simply supply a new line to the model above and make sure that the variable has data on `me_data`:

```{r }
# This is the model definition
model_definition <-
  "~ mpg + cyl
   ~ disp + drat"

# The (fake) measurement error data
me_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                        question = c("mpg", "cyl", "disp", "drat"),
                        reliability = c(0.729, 0.815, 0.68, 0.69),
                        validity = c(0.951, 0.944, 0.79, 0.89),
                        quality = c(0.693, 0.77, 0.89, 0.93)
                      )

# Define your measurement error design
me_obj <- medesign(model_definition, mtcars, me_data)

me_obj
```

Once you have that object, we simply pass it to `me_cmv_cor` to adjust the correlation of `mpg`, `cyl`, and `cyl` for common method variance as well as their quality:

```{r }
me_cmv_cor(me_obj)
```

Alternatively, you can use `me_cmv_cov` to adjust a covariance matrix for common method variance as well as quality.
