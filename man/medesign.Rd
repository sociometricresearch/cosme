\title{Define your measurement error design}
\usage{
medesign(model_syntax, .data, me_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_syntax}{A description of the user-specified model as a character
string. The model is described using the me model syntax. See the details
and example section for on how to write this syntax.}

\item{.data}{a data frame containing all variables defined in
\code{model_syntax}}

\item{me_data}{A dataframe of class \code{me}. Can be created manually
with \code{me_construct}.}
}
\value{
an \code{me} design object which can be passed to other functions
of measurementfree.
}
\description{
The model syntax allows to define the relationship between variables
in terms of whether they share a common method in the question
that was asked. For example, if the questions called \code{stflife}
and \code{stfwork} were both measured with a 1-10 likert scale related
to satisfaction, these two questions were measured with the same method.
The model syntax would specify them like \code{'~ stflife + stfwork'}.
}
\details{
These two questions should also be in \code{.data} and in \code{me_data},
otherwise no calculation can be performed. \code{.data} should be a data
frame with all variables specified in the \code{model_syntax} while
\code{me_data} should be a dataframe with 4 columns: question, reliability,
validity an quality. The first column should contain the names of the
variables as character vector, while the other three should be numeric
vectors with their corresponding reliability, validity and quality
values.

\examples{

# These three variables share a common method
me_syntax <- "~ mpg + cyl + drat"

# Fake data for the example
me_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
                      question = c("mpg", "cyl", "drat"),
                      reliability = c(0.729, 0.815, 0.68),
                      validity = c(0.951, 0.944, 0.79),
                      quality = c(0.693, 0.77, 0.89)
                      )

# Convert your me_data to an me object
me_data <- as_me(me_data)
medesign(me_syntax, mtcars, me_data)


# Each pair of variables share a common method.
me_syntax <-
"# Let's assume these two variables share a common method
 ~ mpg + cyl
 # Let's assume these two variables as well
 ~ drat + disp"

# Fake data for the example
me_data <- data.frame(stringsAsFactors = FALSE,
