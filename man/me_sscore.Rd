\title{Calculate quality of sum score of selected variables}
\usage{
me_sscore(me_data, .data, new_name, ..., wt = NULL, .drop = TRUE)

me_sscore_(me_data, .data, new_name, vars_names, wt = NULL, .drop = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{me_data}{a data frame of class \code{me} containing
quality estimates from the variables specified in \code{...}. It is
expected that this measurement error data is not square rooted (reliability,
validity and quality) as it will be done with \code{me_sscore}.}

\item{.data}{a data frame which contains data for the variables specified
in \code{...}.}

\item{new_name}{a bare unquoted name or a string specifying the name
of the new sum score.}

\item{...}{bare unquoted names or separate strings specifying
the variable names from which to estimate quality of their sum score.
They all must be present in \code{me_data} and \code{.data}. At minimum,
it must be two or more variable names.}

\item{wt}{a non-NA numeric vector of the same length as the variables
specified in \code{...}. This will be used as weights in calculating the
sum scores of all variable. Be default, all variables are given the same
weight.}

\item{.drop}{a logical stating whether to drop the questions that compose
the sum score (these are the variables specified in \code{...}) If
\code{FALSE} it retains the original questions and the sum score.}

\item{vars_names}{character vector specifying the variable names from
which to estimate the quality of the sum score. They all must be present
in \code{me_data} and \code{.data}. At minimum, it must be two or more
variable names.}
}
\value{
a \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} similar to \code{me_data} but
with a new row containing the quality of a sum score.
}
\description{
\code{me_sscore} takes a data frame with quality estimates of class
\code{me} and estimates the quality of a sum score for
selected variables in \code{...}. Use \code{me_sscore_} if you're
interested in programming with \code{me_sscore}
